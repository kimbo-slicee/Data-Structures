# INTRODUCTION ➡ TO DATA STRUCTURES 📊🧱 
### What is Data Structures
A specialized format for organizing, processing, 
retrieving and storing data.
### Why we need Data Structures
 After organizing data it becomes easy to process it.
It is akin to searching for your clothing within an unorganized room, 
a process that consumes considerable time and energy, ultimately leading to frustration. 
Therefore, it is advisable to organize your living space for a quick and efficient retrieval of items.
An important consideration is that this approach minimizes energy expenditure.

### Algorithms
An Algorithm is a set of instruction to perform a task or to solve a given problem 
for example-
### Analysis of Algorithms
Analysis of algorithm deals in finding best algorithm which runs 
fast and takes in less memory  
[1]:Time Complexity 
it is the amount of time taken by algorithm to run 
the input processed by an 
algorithm helps in determining the time complexity 
Note 📝:in java we can use System.CurrentTimeMille function to know the different of time of execution between tow algorithems 📌
 
[2]:Space Complexity
